# JS-Snake-game
----------------
### Simple snake game using JS and CSS Grids
---------------------------------------------

This Snake game will carry the exact logic of the snake game provided in the Console-Snake-Game repository.

This game will have more features like controlling snake-speed, custom gameboard dimensions,etc..


### Contribute
--------------
I have completed all the basic UI and JS functions on the game.
BUT
- changing snake-speed, gameboard dimensions, changing snake color, fruit-color, gameboard-color via an open menubar is still remaining.
- A game-instructions Pop-up is required.
- Hammer.js is required to give swipe funtionality for Mobile
You can add these simple features if you like...

I would be happy to help you if you wanna contribute
