# JS-Snake-game

## Simple snake game using JS and CSS Grids

---------------------------------------------

This Snake game will carry the exact logic of the snake game provided in the Console-Snake-Game repository.

This game will have more features like controlling snake-speed, custom game-board dimensions,etc..

## Contribute

---------------------------------------------

I have completed all the basic UI and JS functions on the game BUT a few simple features are required. Refer the [TODO](## TODO) list below.

You can add these simple features if you like...

I would be happy to help you if you wanna contribute

## Follow the link in the Repo Description to play the game

---------------------------------------------

- Use arrow keys or Swipe gestures for Movements
- pressing P for pause/resume doesn't work for now. efforts have been made to implement( see main.js). since it didn't work i have commented those codes and replaced with other code that doesn't support pause/resume. <> Pending task <>
- Refer Cheat-book [here](https://github.com/ashuvssut/Console-Snake-Game/blob/master/Console-Snake-Game/Cheatbook%20.txt) ;)
  
## Changelog

## TODO

---------------------------------------------

- changing snake-speed, game-board dimensions, changing snake color, fruit-color, game-board-color via an open menubar is still remaining. Variables are set but UI and a little JS implementation required.
- A game-instructions Pop-up is required.
